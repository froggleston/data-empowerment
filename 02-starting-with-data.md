The main goals for this lessons are:

- Ensure learners are comfortable with working with data frames and tibbles, and
  can use the bracket notation to select slices/columns.
- Make sure learners can import data into R and convert data into tibbles for 
  analysis purposes.
- Expose learners to factors. Their behavior is not necessarily intuitive, so it 
  is important that they are guided through it the first time they are
  exposed to it. The content of the lesson should be enough for learners to
  avoid common mistakes with them.
- Expose learners to dates, and ensure they can convert strings to date format
  if need be.

## What is an R package?

An R package is a collection of functions and (occasionally) data sets that
extend the functionality of R. Throughout these lessons, we will primarily be 
using the **`tidyverse`**, which is a collection of R packages designed to make 
data science easier!

When installing and loading **`tidyverse`**, the following are all of the 
packages that are installed/loaded as part of the collection:

- **`ggplot2`**
- **`dplyr`**
- **`tidyr`**
- **`readr`**
- **`tibble`**
- **`forcats`**
- **`lubridate`**
- **`stringr`**
- **`purrr`**

You can learn more about the **`tidyverse`** collection of packages by visiting 
the [tidyverse website](https://www.tidyverse.org/).

There are also packages available for a wide range of tasks including 
downloading data from the NCBI database or performing statistical analysis on 
your data set. Many packages such as these are housed on, and downloadable from, 
the **C**omprehensive **R** **A**rchive **N**etwork (CRAN) using 
`install.packages`. This function makes the package accessible by your R 
installation with the command `library()`.

To easily access the documentation for a package within R or RStudio, use
`help(package = "package_name")`.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  callout

## Note

There are alternatives to the `tidyverse` packages for data wrangling, including
the package [`data.table`](https://rdatatable.gitlab.io/data.table/). See this
[comparison](https://mgimond.github.io/rug_2019_12/Index.html)
for example to get a sense of the differences between using `base`, `tidyverse`, 
and `data.table`.

## What are data frames?

Data frames are the *de facto* data structure for tabular data in `R`, and what
we use for data processing, statistics, and plotting.

A data frame is the representation of data in the format of a table where the
columns are vectors that all have the same length. Data frames are analogous to
the more familiar spreadsheet in programs such as Excel, with one key difference.
Because columns are vectors,
each column must contain a single type of data (e.g., characters, integers,
factors). For example, here is a figure depicting a data frame comprising a
numeric, a character, and a logical vector.

![](fig/data-frame.svg){alt='A 3 by 3 data frame with columns showing numeric, character and logical values.'}

Data frames can be created by hand, but most commonly they are generated by the
functions `read_csv()` or `read_table()`; in other words, when importing
spreadsheets from your hard drive (or the web). We will now demonstrate how to
import tabular data using `read_csv()`.

## Introduction to the Check-In Dataset

The Check-In Dataset is an example data set that is based on the 2018 election. 
Each row in the data set represents one ballot case, and includes an ID, check-in 
length, arrival time, location, precinct, and machine.

The following is a visual representation of the data set's columns:

| column\_name         | description                                                                                                                      | 
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| checkin\_id          | Provides a unique key/ID for each ballot instance.                                                                               | 
| checkin\_length      | How long it took the person submitting the ballot to check-in to the polling location.                                           | 
| checkin\_time        | The arrival time of the person submitting the ballot, includes both the date and time.                                           | 
| location             | Anonymized ID for the location of the ballot box.                                                                                | 
| precinct             | Anonymized ID for the precinct that the ballot box belongs to.                                                                   | 
| device               | Anonymized ID for each ballot box.                                                                                               | 

## Importing Data

You are going to load the data in R's memory using the function `read_csv()`.
This is from the **`readr`** package, which (as you may remember) is part of 
the **`tidyverse`**.

Before proceeding, however, this is a good opportunity to talk about conflicts.
Certain packages we load can end up introducing function names that are already
in use by pre-loaded R packages. For instance, when we load the tidyverse 
package below, we will introduce two conflicting functions: `filter()` and `lag()`.
This happens because `filter` and `lag` are already functions used by the stats
package (which comes pre-loaded in R). What will happen now is that if we, for
example, call the `filter()` function, R will use the `dplyr::filter()` version
and not the `stats::filter()` one. This happens because, if conflicted, by 
default R uses the function from the most recently loaded package. Conflicted
functions may cause you some trouble in the future, so it is important that we
are aware of them so that we can properly handle them, if we want.

To do so, we just need the following functions from the conflicted package:  

- `conflicted::conflict_scout()`: Shows us any conflicted functions.  
- `conflict_prefer("function", "package_prefered")`:  Allows us to choose the
default function we want from now on.  

It is also important to know that we can, at any time, just call the function
directly from the package we want, such as `stats::filter()`.

Even with the use of an RStudio project, it can be difficult to learn how to
specify paths to file locations. Enter the **here** package! The here package
creates paths relative to the top-level directory (your RStudio project). These
relative paths work *regardless* of where the associated source file lives
inside your project, like analysis projects with data and reports in different
sub-directories.  This is an important contrast to using `setwd()`, which
depends on the way you order your files on your computer.

Before we can use the `read_csv()` and `here()` functions, we need to load the
tidyverse and here packages.


``` r
#loads in the tidyverse and here packages
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
```

``` error
Error in library(here): there is no package called 'here'
```

``` r
#reads in data and assigns it to the 'data' variable using 'here'
data <- read_csv(here("data", "checkin_data.csv"))
```

``` error
Error in here("data", "checkin_data.csv"): could not find function "here"
```

In the above code, we notice the `here()` function takes folder and file names
as inputs (e.g., `"data"`, `"checkin_data.csv"`), each enclosed in quotations
(`""`) and separated by a comma. The `here()` will accept as many names as are
necessary to navigate to a particular file.

For example, let's say you have both an RMarkdown file and a folder called 
`"info"` that contains multiple CSV files (including `"data.csv"`) on your 
Desktop. If you want to access `"data.csv"` within your RMarkdown file, you can 
use `here("info", "data.csv")`.

The `here()` function can accept the folder and file names in an alternate format,
using a slash ("/") rather than commas to separate the names. The two methods are
equivalent, so that `here("data", "checkin_data.csv")` and
`here("data/checkin_data.csv")` produce the same result. (The forward slash 
is used on all operating systems; backslashes are never used.)

If you were to type in the code above, it is likely that the `read.csv()`
function would appear in the automatically populated list of functions. This
function is different from the `read_csv()` function, as it is included in the
"base" packages that come pre-installed with R. Overall, `read.csv()` behaves
similar to `read_csv()`, with a few notable differences. First, `read.csv()`
coerces column names with spaces and/or special characters to different names
(e.g. `interview date` becomes `interview.date`). 

Second, `read.csv()` stores data as a `data.frame`, where `read_csv()` stores data 
as a different kind of data frame called a `tibble`. A tibble is an extension of 
`R` data frames used by the **`tidyverse`**. We prefer tibbles because they have 
nice printing properties among other desirable qualities. You can read more about 
[tibbles in its docs](https://tibble.tidyverse.org/).


Additionally, the `read_csv()` statement in the code above creates a tibble but 
doesn't output any data because, as you might recall, assignments (`<-`) don't 
display anything. Note, however, that `read_csv` may show informational text about the 
data frame that is created. 

If we want to check that our tibble has been loaded, we can see the contents of the 
data by typing its name: `data` in the console:

``` r
data

## Note

`read_csv()` assumes that fields are delimited by commas (since CSV stands for 
"Comma Separated Values"). However, in several countries, the comma is used as a 
decimal separator and the semicolon (;) is used as a field delimiter. If you want 
to read in this type of files in R, you can use the `read_csv2` function. It 
behaves exactly like `read_csv` but uses different parameters for the decimal 
and the field separators. If you are working with another format, they can be 
both specified by the user. Check out the help for `read_csv()` by typing 
`?read_csv` to learn more. There is also the `read_tsv()` for tab-separated data 
files, and `read_delim()` allows you to specify more details about the structure 
of your file.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

When the data is read using `read_csv()`, it is stored in an object of class
`tbl_df`, `tbl`,  and `data.frame`. You can see the class of an object using:

``` r
class(data)
```

``` output
[1] "function"
```

As a `tibble`, the type of data included in each column is listed in an
abbreviated fashion below the column names. For instance, here `checkin_id` is a 
column of characters (`<chr>`),`precinct` is a column of floating point numbers 
(abbreviated `<dbl>` for the word 'double'), and the `checkin_time` is a column 
in the "date and time" format (`<dttm>` or `<S3: POSIXct>`).

## Inspecting Tibbles

When calling a `tbl_df` object (like `data` here), there is already a lot
of information about our tibble being displayed, such as the number of rows,
the number of columns, the names of the columns, and, as we just saw, the class of
data stored in each column. However, there are functions to extract this
information from tibbles.  Here is a non-exhaustive list of some of these
functions. Let's try them out!

Size:

- `dim(data)` - returns a vector with the number of rows as the first element, 
   and the number of columns as the second element (the **dim**ensions of the 
   object)
- `nrow(data)` - returns the number of rows
- `ncol(data)` - returns the number of columns

Content:

- `head(data)` - shows the first 6 rows
- `tail(data)` - shows the last 6 rows

Names:

- `names(data)` - returns the column names (synonym of `colnames()` for
  `data.frame` objects)

Summary:

- `str(data)` - structure of the object and information about the class,
  length and content of each column
- `summary(data)` - summary statistics for each column
- `glimpse(data)` - returns the number of columns and rows of the tibble,
  the names and class of each column, and previews as many values will fit on the
  screen. Unlike the other inspecting functions listed above, `glimpse()` is not a
  "base R" function so you need to have the `dplyr` or `tibble` packages loaded to
  be able to execute it.

Note: most of these functions are "generic." They can be used on other types of
objects besides data frames or tibbles.

## Subsetting Tibbles

Our `data` tibble has rows and columns (it has 2 dimensions).
In practice, we may not need the entire tibble; for instance, we may only
be interested in a subset of the observations (the rows) or a particular set
of variables (the columns). If we want to access some specific data from it, we 
need to specify the "coordinates" (i.e., indices) we want from it. Row numbers 
come first, followed by column numbers.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  callout

## Tip

Subsetting a `tibble` with `[` always results in a `tibble`.
However, note this is not true in general for data frames, so be careful!
Different ways of specifying these coordinates can lead to results with

`:` is a special function that creates numeric vectors of integers in increasing
or decreasing order, test `1:10` and `10:1` for instance.

You can also exclude certain indices of a tibble using the "`-`" sign:


``` r
#retrieves the whole tibble (minus the first column)
data[, -1]
```

``` error
Error in data[, -1]: object of type 'closure' is not subsettable
```

``` r
#equivalent to head(data)
data[-c(7:352112), ]
```

``` error
Error in data[-c(7:352112), ]: object of type 'closure' is not subsettable
```

`tibble`s can be subset by calling indices (as shown previously), but also by
calling their column names directly:


``` r
#returns a tibble
data["location"]

#returns a tibble
data[, "location"]

#returns a vector
data[["location"]]

#returns a vector
data$location
```

In RStudio, you can use the **`auto-completion feature`** to get the full and 
correct names of the columns.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  challenge

## Exercise

1. Create a tibble (`data_100`) containing only the data in
   row 100 of the `data` data set.

Now, continue using `data` for each of the following activities: 

2. Notice how `nrow()` gave you the number of rows in the tibble?

- Use that number to pull out just that last row in the tibble.
- Compare that with what you see as the last row using `tail()` to make
  sure it's meeting expectations.
- Pull out that last row using `nrow()` instead of the row number.
- Create a new tibble (`data_last`) from that last row.

3. Using the number of rows in the Check-In Dataset that you found in
   question 2, extract the rows that are in the middle of the data set. Store
   the content of these middle rows in an object named `data_middle`.
   (hint: the middle two items of a set of 4 would be 2 + 3, or visually, 
   [][X][X][])

4. Combine `nrow()` with the `-` notation above to reproduce the behavior of
   `head(data)`, keeping just the first through 6th rows of the Check-In
   Dataset.

## Factors

R has a special data class, called factors, to deal with categorical data that
you may encounter when creating plots or doing statistical analyses. Factors are
very useful and play a key role in making R particularly well suited to working 
with data. 

Factors represent categorical data. They are stored as integers associated with
labels, and can be ordered (ordinal) or unordered (nominal). Factors create a 
structured relation between the different levels (values) of a categorical 
variable, such as days of the week or responses to a question in a survey. This 
can make it easier to see how one element relates to the other elements in a 
column. While factors look (and often behave) like character vectors, they are 
actually treated as integer vectors by `R`. So, you need to be very careful when 
treating them as strings.

Once created, factors can only contain a pre-defined set of values, known as
*levels*. By default, R always sorts levels in alphabetical order. For
instance, if you have a factor with 2 levels:


``` r
ballot_type <- factor(c("in-person", "absentee", "in-person", "in-person", "absentee"))
```

R will assign `1` to the level `"absentee"` and `2` to the level `"in-person"`
(because `a` comes before `i`, even though the first element in this vector is
`"in-person"`). You can see this by using the function `levels()` and you can 
find the number of levels using `nlevels()`:


``` r
levels(ballot_type)
```

``` output
[1] "absentee"  "in-person"
```

``` r
nlevels(ballot_type)
```

``` output
[1] 2
```

Sometimes, the order of the factors does not matter. Other times you might want
to specify the order because it is meaningful (e.g., "low", "medium", "high").
It may improve your visualization, or it may be required by a particular type of
analysis. Here, one way to reorder our levels in the `ballot_type` vector would 
be:


``` r
ballot_type #current order
```

``` output
[1] in-person absentee  in-person in-person absentee 
Levels: absentee in-person
```

``` r
ballot_type <- factor(ballot_type, 
                      levels = c("in-person", "absentee"))

ballot_type #re-ordered
```

``` output
[1] in-person absentee  in-person in-person absentee 
Levels: in-person absentee
```

In R's memory, these factors are represented by integers (1, 2), but are more
informative than integers because factors are self describing: `"in-person"`,
`"absentee"` is more descriptive than `1`, and `2`. Which one is "absentee"? You
wouldn't be able to tell just from the integer data. Factors, however, have this 
information built in. It is particularly helpful when there are many levels, and 
makes renaming levels easier. Let's say we made a mistake and need to recode 
"in-person" to "provisional". We can do this using the `fct_recode()` function 
from the **`forcats`** package (included in the **`tidyverse`**) -- a package 
that provides some extra tools to work with factors.


``` r
levels(ballot_type)
```

``` output
[1] "in-person" "absentee" 
```

``` r
ballot_type <- fct_recode(ballot_type, 
                          "provisional" = "in-person")

#alternatively, we could change the "in-person" level directly using the 
#levels() function, but we have to remember that "in-person" is the first level
#levels(ballot_type)[1] <- "provisional"

levels(ballot_type)
```

``` output
[1] "provisional" "absentee"   
```

``` r
ballot_type
```

``` output
[1] provisional absentee    provisional provisional absentee   
Levels: provisional absentee
```

So far, your factor is unordered, like a nominal variable. R does not know the
difference between a nominal and an ordinal variable. You make your factor an
ordered factor by using the `ordered = TRUE` option inside your factor function.
Note how the reported levels changed from the unordered factor above to the
ordered version below. Ordered levels use the less than sign `<` to denote
level ranking.


``` r
ballot_type_ordered <- factor(ballot_type, 
                              ordered = TRUE)

ballot_type_ordered #now ordered
```

``` output
[1] provisional absentee    provisional provisional absentee   
Levels: provisional < absentee
```

### Converting Factors

If you need to convert a factor to a character vector, you use
`as.character(x)`.


``` r
as.character(ballot_type)
```

``` output
[1] "provisional" "absentee"    "provisional" "provisional" "absentee"   
```

Converting factors where the levels appear as numbers (such as concentration
levels, or years) to a numeric vector is a little trickier. The `as.numeric()`
function returns the index values of the factor, not its levels, so it will
result in an entirely new (and unwanted in this case) set of numbers.
One method to avoid this is to convert factors to characters, and then to
numbers. Another method is to use the `levels()` function. Compare:


``` r
year_fct <- factor(c(1990, 1983, 1977, 1998, 1990))

as.numeric(year_fct)                     #wrong! and with no warning either...
```

``` output
[1] 3 2 1 4 3
```

``` r
as.numeric(as.character(year_fct))       #technically works...
```

``` output
[1] 1990 1983 1977 1998 1990
```

``` r
as.numeric(levels(year_fct))[year_fct]   #recommended methodology! :)
```

``` output
[1] 1990 1983 1977 1998 1990
```

Notice that in the recommended `levels()` approach, three important steps occur:

- We obtain all the factor levels using `levels(year_fct)`
- We convert these levels to numeric values using `as.numeric(levels(year_fct))`
- We then access these numeric values using the underlying integers of the
  vector `year_fct` inside the square brackets

### Renaming Factors

When your data is stored as a factor, you can use the `plot()` function to get a
quick glance at the number of observations represented by each factor level.
Let's create some new data called `ballotData`, convert it into a factor, and
use it to look at the number of ballots that are in-person or absentee:


``` r
#create data
ballotData <- c("in-person", "in-person", "in-person", "in-person", "in-person", "in-person", "in-person", "absentee", "absentee", "absentee", "absentee", "absentee", NA, NA)

#convert it into a factor
ballotData <- as.factor(ballotData)

#prints out the data (as a vector)
ballotData
```

``` output
 [1] in-person in-person in-person in-person in-person in-person in-person
 [8] absentee  absentee  absentee  absentee  absentee  <NA>      <NA>     
Levels: absentee in-person
```

``` r
#bar plot of the number of cases per ballot type:
plot(ballotData)
```

<img src="fig/02-starting-with-data-rendered-factor-plot-default-order-1.png" alt="Bar plot of Number of Cases per Ballot Type" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

Looking at the plot compared to the output of the vector, we can see that in
addition to "absentee"s and "in-person"s, there are some people for whom their 
ballot type was not noted. Consequently, these people do not appear on the plot! 
Let's encode them differently so they can be counted and visualized in our plot.


``` r
#recreates the data
ballotData <- c("in-person", "in-person", "in-person", "in-person", "in-person", "in-person", "in-person", "absentee", "absentee", "absentee", "absentee", "absentee", NA, NA)

#replace the missing data with "undetermined"
ballotData[is.na(ballotData)] <- "undetermined"

#convert it into a factor
ballotData <- as.factor(ballotData)

#prints out the data (as a vector)
ballotData
```

``` output
 [1] in-person    in-person    in-person    in-person    in-person   
 [6] in-person    in-person    absentee     absentee     absentee    
[11] absentee     absentee     undetermined undetermined
Levels: absentee in-person undetermined
```

``` r
#bar plot of the number of cases per ballot type:
plot(ballotData)
```

<img src="fig/02-starting-with-data-rendered-factor-plot-reorder-1.png" alt="Bar plot of Number of Cases per Ballot Type (including missing values)" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  challenge

## Exercise

1. Rename the levels of the factor to be in title case:
   "Absentee","In-Person", and "Undetermined".

2, Now that we have renamed the factor level to "Undetermined", can you
   recreate the bar plot such that "Undetermined" is first (before "Absentee")?

                         "Undetermined" = "undetermined")

#part 2:

                     levels = c("Undetermined", "Absentee", "In-Person"))

## Formatting Dates

Recall our coverage of dates in "Intro to R".  A best practice for dealing with 
date data is to ensure that each component of your date is available as a 
separate variable. In our data set, we have a column `checkin_time` which 
contains information about the year, month, day, hour, minute, and second that 
the person that submitted the ballot arrived in the building. Let's convert 
those dates into six separate columns.


``` r
str(data)
```

We are going to use the package **`lubridate`**, which is included in the 
**`tidyverse`** installation and should be loaded by default. However, if we 
deal with older versions of tidyverse (2022 and earlier), we can manually load it 
by typing `library(lubridate)`.

If necessary, start by loading the required package:


``` r
library(lubridate)
```

The lubridate function `ymd_hms()` takes a vector representing year, month, day,
hour, minutes, and seconds and converts it to a `Date` vector.

Let's extract our `checkin_time` column and inspect the structure:


``` r
times <- data$checkin_time
```

``` error
Error in data$checkin_time: object of type 'closure' is not subsettable
```

``` r
str(times)
```

``` error
Error: object 'times' not found
```

When we imported the data in R, `read_csv()` recognized that this column
contained date information. We can now use the `day()`, `month()`,  `year()`,
`hour()`, `minute()`,  and `second()` functions to extract this information from 
the date, and create new columns in our tibble to store it:


``` r
data$day <- day(times)
```

``` error
Error: object 'times' not found
```

``` r
data$month <- month(times)
```

``` error
Error: object 'times' not found
```

``` r
data$year <- year(times)
```

``` error
Error: object 'times' not found
```

``` r
data$hour <- hour(times)
```

``` error
Error: object 'times' not found
```

``` r
data$minute <- minute(times)
```

``` error
Error: object 'times' not found
```

``` r
data$seconds <- second(times)
```

``` error
Error: object 'times' not found
```

``` r

```

Notice the six new columns at the end of our tibble.

In our example above, the `checkin_time` column was read in correctly as a
`Date` variable but generally that is not the case. Date columns are often read
in as `character` variables and, similarly to how you can convert character 
variables to dates using the `as_date()` function, columns can be converted to 
the appropriate `Date/POSIXct`format.

 
Let's say we have a generic tibble of IDs and character dates, as configured:

``` r
data2 <- tibble(
  ID = c("001", "002", "003"),
  Date = c("01/05/2025", "04/23/2024", "12/25/1987")
)

data2
```

``` output
# A tibble: 3 × 2
  ID    Date      
  <chr> <chr>     
1 001   01/05/2025
2 002   04/23/2024
3 003   12/25/1987
```

As you can see, the `Date` column is stored as characters. We can easily convert
this to a date type by doing one of the following:

``` r
#option 1: base R (as.Date)
data2$Date1 <- as.Date(data2$Date, format = "%m/%d/%Y")

#option 2: lubridate (mdy)
data2$Date2 <- mdy(data2$Date)

data2
```

``` output
# A tibble: 3 × 4
  ID    Date       Date1      Date2     
  <chr> <chr>      <date>     <date>    
1 001   01/05/2025 2025-01-05 2025-01-05
2 002   04/23/2024 2024-04-23 2024-04-23
3 003   12/25/1987 1987-12-25 1987-12-25
```

`Date1` and `Date2` store the exact same data! Lubridate is preferred to base R, 
but either function can be used.

## Outputting Data

Occasionally, after editing a data set within RStudio, you may want to output the
updated data set to a CSV file. This would allow you to open the updated information
in Excel, Google Sheets, or a different RMarkdown file!

To output a file to CSV, we will be using the `write_csv()` function from the 
**`readr`** package. Below, we will be outputting our updated data with our new
date and time columns as `"checkin_data_2.csv"`:


``` r
#takes the tibble and outputs it as a csv file
write_csv(data, "data/checkin_data_2.csv")
```

``` error
Error in write_delim(x, file, delim = ",", na = na, append = append, col_names = col_names, : is.data.frame(x) is not TRUE
```

When choosing the name for the new file, ensure there are no files with the same
name. By default, `write_csv()` will overwrite any files of the same name without a
warning!

Additionally, you may have noticed we included the file path when specifying the 
name of the new CSV. When creating any sort of new file -- whether that be an image, 
CSV, or otherwise -- R will place the file in the current working directory! In 
other words, R will always place new files in the same folder as the RMarkdown you're 
working in, unless specified otherwise.

Since we have a specific folder (called `"data"`) to store our csv files, we
specify that we want the new CSV file to go in that folder by adding `"data/"`
before the file name!

If you want to output your new csv to a different file outside of the working 
directory, you can use an entire file path (ex. 
`"C:/Users/name/Documents/checkin_data_2.csv"`) to specify exactly where you 
want the file to be saved.

Note: similarly to reading in CSV files, **`readr`** has a alternate version of
`write_csv()` called `write_csv2()` that uses commas as decimal separators and 
semicolons as field delimiters.
